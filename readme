Linux cryptsetup Perl interface for creating/managing LUKS devices.

It's primarily designed for a fully-encrypted SFTP, web-hosting, or cloud storage solution, where files are stored in a LUKS-encrypted image. This setup uses dm-crypt in plain mode to ensure security for both users and administrators, with the added benefit of plausible deniability and protection against key-disclosure laws.

The interface uses a unique keyfile for each user, which is encrypted at rest on the server using AES-256. The encryption key for the keyfile is derived from the user's passphrase via PBKDF2. Mount points are based on an MD5 digest, and the keyfile is securely shredded with 10 passes and zero-filled when the LUKS image is mounted.
